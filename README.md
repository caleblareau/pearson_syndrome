# Pearson Syndrome single-cell genomics analysis repository
_Caleb Lareau_ 

This repository contains code needed to reproduce analyses and figures assocaited with this work:

Lareau, _et al._ *Cellular states, evolution, and clonal dynamics in Pearson syndrome revealed via single-cell multi-omics*. bioRxiv. 2021.

**Note** these are the primary analysis figure : folder mapping, but a low number selected panels from other folders were used in certain figures to make supporting points.
